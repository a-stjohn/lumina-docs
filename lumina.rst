Introduction to Lumina
**********************

The Lumina Desktop Environment (Lumina for short) is a lightweight, 
XDG-compliant, BSD-licensed desktop environment that focuses 
specifically on streamlining the ability to get work done while 
minimizing system overhead. It is specifically designed for PC-BSD® and 
FreeBSD, but has also been ported to many other BSD and Linux operating 
systems. It is based on the Qt graphical toolkit and the Fluxbox window 
manager, and uses a small number of X utilities for various tasks, such 
as :command:`numlockx` and :command:`xscreensaver`.

Lumina's features include: 

* Very little system overhead.

* Does not require any of desktop implementation frameworks such as 
  DBUS, policykit, consolekit, systemd, or HALD.

* Does not come bundled with any applications such as web browsers, 
  email clients, multimedia software, or office suites. Instead, it 
  provides utilities for configuring the desktop environment.

* Uses a simple, `text-based configuration file for setting system-wide defaults <https://github.com/pcbsd/lumina/blob/master/src-qt5/core/lumina-desktop/defaults/luminaDesktop.conf>`_. 
  This allows Lumina distributors to easily preset the Lumina defaults 
  and interface for their distribution.

* Provides a plugin-based interface design. This allows the user to make
  the desktop as light or heavy as desired by choosing which plugins to 
  have running on their desktop and panels. This plugin-based system is 
  similar to Android or other modern operating systems.
  
* Single, easy-to-use :ref:`Lumina Configuration` utility controls all 
  the different configuration options for the desktop in one location.

* Intelligent "favorites" system for creating quick shortcuts to 
  applications, files, and directories.

* ZFS file restore functionality through the :ref:`Insight File Manager`.

* Simple access to operating system-specific functionality such as 
  screen brightness, audio volume, and battery status.

* Multi-monitor support includes the :ref:`Lumina Xconfig` graphical 
  utility for adding or removing monitors from the Lumina session.

* Simple system controls through the system menu for configuring audio 
  volume, screen brightness, battery status/notifications, and workspace
  switching.

* Total system search capabilities through :ref:`Lumina Search`, without
  a daemon eating memory in the background.

* Screenshot functionality through :ref:`Lumina Screenshot` which is 
  also tied to the “Print Screen” key by default.

.. _How to Get Lumina:

How to Get Lumina
=================

Lumina is available as a pre-built package for numerous operating 
systems. The `Get Lumina <http://lumina-desktop.org/get-lumina/>`_ 
section of the webpage includes installation instructions for each 
supported system.

In addition to pre-built packages, the 
`Lumina source repository <https://github.com/pcbsd/lumina>`_ 
is available on GitHub so that developers can contribute code or create
packages for other distributions. If you plan to compile Lumina from 
source, refer to `DEPENDENCIES <https://github.com/pcbsd/lumina/blob/master/DEPENDENCIES>`_ 
and ensure all dependent software is installed and to 
`README <https://github.com/pcbsd/lumina/blob/master/README.md>`_ for 
build instructions.

Once installed, add :command:`start-lumina-desktop` as the name of the 
binary in your :file:`.startx`, :file:`.xinitrc`, or similar X startup 
file.

.. note:: No startup configuration is needed when installed on a PC-BSD®
          system as the PCDM login manager will automatically display 
          Lumina in the login menu. Simply log out, select Lumina,
          and log back in.
   
The rest of this Handbook describes the Lumina Configuration utility and
the various utilities which are built into Lumina. It then describes how
you can contribute to the Lumina Project and lists the changelogs for 
each version of Lumina.

* **Start menu:** provides quick access for user interaction with the 
  system. The top frame indicates which user is logged in. If the system
  has a battery, you can hover over the battery icon (not pictured) to 
  display the current status of the battery and the estimated time 
  remaining if that battery is discharging.

* **Favorites:** this element is the largest section of the menu. Click 
  an entry to launch that application. Right-click an entry to "Remove 
  from Favorites" or to "Add to Quicklaunch". In Lumina, "Favorites"
  appear in this section of the start menu and "QuickLaunch" adds a 
  button for the application to the panel that is next to the start menu
  button.

* **Browse Files:** used to browse for files and directories using the 
  :ref:`Insight File Manager`. One of the actions available in this file
  manager is the ability to add a file or directory to the list of 
  Favorites. Simply select the file or directory and click the star icon
  in Insight.

* **Browse Applications:** click this entry to browse all the 
  applications currently registered on the system. Applications are 
  listed alphabetically by category and the "Show Categories" button has
  three modes. Click "Show Categories" to toggle between showing just 
  the category names (black box icon), just the contents of the 
  categories (white box icon), or the categories and their contents 
  (1/2 black 1/2 white icon). Click an application's name to start that 
  application. If you right-click an application's name, you can "Pin to
  Desktop", "Add to Favorites", or "Add to Quicklaunch". If you are 
  running PC-BSD® or another operating system that has a pre-defined 
  application store, click "Manage Applications" at the top of the list 
  of applications in order to open that application store. For example, 
  on a PC-BSD® system, "Manage Applications" opens AppCafe®. Click the 
  "Back" button to return to the start menu.

* **Control Panel:** if you are on PC-BSD®, or an operating system which
  provides a control panel, click this entry to open that operating 
  system's control panel.

* **Preferences:** click this entry to access the following:

* **Configure Desktop:** click this entry to open the 
  :ref:`Lumina Configuration` utility.

  * **Lumina Desktop Information:** click the "?" icon to determine the 
    installed version of Lumina.

  * **System Volume:** use your mouse to move the volume control slider 
    to change the system audio volume from 0% to 100%. Click the sound 
    icon on the left to mute or unmute the speaker. If the operating 
    system provides a mixer utility, click the speaker icon on the right
    to launch that mixer utility for advanced control of the audio 
    system.

  * **Screen Brightness:** use your mouse to move the brightness control
    slider from 10% to 100%.

  * **Workspace:** the number of available virtual workspaces are 
    listed. Click the right or left arrow to switch between workspaces.

  * **Locale:** this will only appear if the lumina-i18n package is 
    installed. The current locale will be displayed as the title of the 
    drop-down menu. Click the drop-down menu to select another locale 
    for this session. Refer to :ref:`Session` for more information on 
    fine-tuning the locale settings.

  * **Back:** click to return to the start menu.
  
* **Leave:** click this entry in order to "Suspend System" (if the 
  operating system supports it, press the system's power button to login
  and resume operation) "Restart System" (if the user has permission), 
  "Power Off system" (if the user has permission), "Sign Out User", or 
  to go "Back" to the system menu. Alternately, click the "lock" icon 
  next to "Leave" to lock the system and return it to a login prompt.

.. note:: On a PC-BSD system which is in the middle of applying updates,
          the shutdown and restart options will be disabled until the 
          updates are complete and a note will indicate that updates are
          in progress.

.. _Panel and System Tray:

Panel and System Tray
=====================

By default, Lumina provides a panel at the bottom of the screen with a 
system tray at the far right of the panel. This section describes the 
default layout. For instructions on how to configure the panel to suit 
your needs, refer to the "Panels" tab :ref:`Interface` section.
  
As you open windows or applications, a button will be added to the 
section of the panel near the system menu. If the application provides 
an icon, the button will appear as that icon and if you mouse over it, 
the tooltip will show the name of the application. If you have multiple 
copies of an application running, it will combine all those entries into
a single button and list the number of windows after the icon. If you 
click on a button, it will automatically make that window active and if 
you click it again, it will automatically minimize it. If there are 
multiple windows, you can select the particular window you want to 
activate from a drop-down menu.

If you right-click the title of an open window, a menu of options will 
appear so that you can shade, stick, maximize, iconify, raise, lower, 
set the window title, send the window to a workspace, layer/dock the 
window, set the window's transparency, remember a specified setting, or 
close the window.

The system tray is located in the right portion of the panel. Any 
applications that register a tray icon will appear in this area. For 
example, on a PC-BSD system, icons will appear for Life Preserver, Mount
Tray, and Update Manager. Click or right-click an icon to interact with 
that application directly. The current system time shown by the clock is
in the default format for the current locale. If you click the clock 
icon and then click "Time Zone", a menu will open where you can select 
to either "Use System Time" or click a country name in order to select a
city to change to that city's time zone.
  
.. index:: right-click menu
.. _Right Click Menu:

Right-Click Menu
================

If you right-click the desktop, a menu of quick shortcuts will appear 
and the title of the menu will indicate the name of the current 
workspace. This section describes the default menu items. For 
instructions on how to configure the right-click panel to suit your 
needs, refer to the "Desktop" tab :ref:`Interface` section.

By default, the right-click menu contains the following items:

* **Terminal:** used to launch a system terminal. The default is 
  :command:`xterm`, but this can be customized.

* **Browse Files:** launches the default, and recommended, file manager,
  the :ref:`Insight File Manager`.

* **Applications:** provides shortcuts to the operating system's 
  graphical software management utility (if available), the control 
  panel (if the operating system provides one), and the applications 
  currently registered on the system, arranged by system category.

* **Preferences:** contains shortcuts to the screensaver preferences, 
  :ref:`Lumina Configuration` utility, display configuration 
  (:ref:`Lumina Xconfig`), the operating system's control panel, and for
  determining the version of Lumina.

* **Leave:** opens the system log out window, with options to log out of
  the desktop session, restart the system (if the user has permission), 
  shutdown the system (if the user has permission), cancel the log out 
  window, lock the system, or suspend the system (if the operating 
  system supports suspend mode).
