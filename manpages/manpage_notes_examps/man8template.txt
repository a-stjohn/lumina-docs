General Rules for Manpages:

Category #s (FreeBSD):

1     FreeBSD General Commands Manual
2	  FreeBSD System Calls Manual
3	  FreeBSD Library Functions Manual
4	  FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual
5	  FreeBSD File Formats Manua
6	  FreeBSD Games Manual
7     FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual
8	  FreeBSD System Manager's Manual
9     FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

There is a standardized naming convention in place for manpage files:
name.#.gz

ALWAYS have a document prologue with the .Dd, .Dt, and .Os macros.

6 Mandatory .Sh sections for all manpages (in order):
.Sh NAME
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sh <ALL USER CREATED SECTIONS>
.Sh FILES
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Sh AUTHORS

All other section headers are user-created and are placed between DESCRIPTION and FILES, as noted above. Common headers: USAGE EXAMPLES, HISTORY, BACKGROUND

NAME must have at least one .Nm followed by one .Nd.
FILES lists the pathway to the base directory and any config files  (.conf)
SEE ALSO lists other manpages the reader may need to review. There are two syntaxes: .Xr manpage 1 OR manpage(1)


EXAMPLE Manpage copied from pc-sysconfig.8 (mount tray tools): /Projects/pc-mountray/src-qt5/pc-sysconfig/pcsysconfig.8

.Dd January 1, 2001 <date manpage created: Month Day, Year>
.Dt TEMPLATE 8 # manpage-name and category #. Name must be UPPERCASE only
.Os 1.0 # Release version

.Sh NAME # Section Header, must be UPPERCASE. Always have NAME first
.Nm Template Man 8 # Display Name
.Nd Template for creating man8 pages. # Brief command description

.Sh SYNOPSIS # SYNOPSIS is always next; lists condensed command with arguments.
.Nm # Displays defined .Nm above (Template Man 8)
.Op Ar "command option1 option2" "command2 option1 option2" ... # List all commands with options.
.Op Fl "devinfo <device> [skiplabel]" # .Op is used to format flags [Fl] in bold with brackets
.Op Fl "mount <device> [<filesystem>] [<mountpoint>]"

.Sh DESCRIPTION # Details of the commands of options with descriptive text
The # Descriptive text flows around [.Zz] identifiers
.Nm # .Nm must be on its own line, uses defined .Nm above
template is a simple 
configuration tool written for pc-bsd.
.Pp # blank line position holder
The list commands available to you are
.Bl -tag -width indent # .Bl -tag -width indent will indent all following content
.It \fBlist-remdev\fR # .It \fB[text]\fR Add the bold element to the text
List all removable devices attached to the system. # (not used here) .El will end the indented section.
.It \fBlist-mounteddev\fR
List all removable devices that are currently mounted
.It \fBlist-audiodev\fR
List all available audio devices
.It \fBprobe-netdrives\fR
List all the available shared drives on the local network
.It \fBlist-mountednetdrives\fR
 List all the available shared drives which can currently be browsed (assuming the remote system is running properly)
.It \fBsupportedfilesystems\fR
List all the filesystems that are currently detected/supported
.It \fBdevinfo <device> [skiplabel]\fR
 Fetch device information (Filesystem, Label, Type)
.It \fBdevsize <device>\fR
Fetch space of mounted device
.It \fBusingtormode\fR
Returns whether or not the system is routing all traffic through tor as TRUE or FALSE
.It \fBgetscreenbrightness\fR
Returns the brightness of the first controllable screen as a percentage or "[ERROR]" otherwise
.It \fBsystemcansuspend\fR
Returns whether the system supports the S3 suspend state returns a TRUE or FALSE

.Pp # Blank line
The available action commands available to you are
.It \fBmount <device> [<filesystem>] [<mountpoint>]\fR
This will mount the removable device on the system 
(with user-accessible permissions if the mountpoint 
needs to be created)
.Pp
If there is no filesystem set (or "auto" is 
used), it will try to use the one that is 
auto-detected for the device
.Pp
If there is no mountpoint set, it will assign a 
new mountpoint within the "/media/" directory based on 
the device label
.It \fBunmount <device or mountpoint> [force]\fR
This will unmount the removable device from the system
.Pp
This may be forced by using the "force" flag as 
well (this is never recommended but may be required in the case that 
hald is pinging the device and keeping it marked as active.)
.Pp
If the input device is a memory disk (/dev/md*), then 
it will automatically remove the memory disk from the 
system as well
.It \fBmountnet <IP of remote host> <Name of remote host>\fR
This will setup the remote host to be browsable on the 
local system with the given name
.Pp
Note that the remote host is automatically 
mounted/unmounted based on local user activity
.Pp
The remote host is automatically 
mounted/unmounted based on local user activity
.It \fBunmountnet <IP of remote host>\fR
This will remove the remote host from being browsable 
on the local system
.It \fBload-iso <path to iso>\fR
This will load the ISO file as a memory disk on the 
system making it available to mount
.Pp
The path must be an absolute path
.It \fBsuspendsystem\fR
Puts system in s3 suspend state
.It \fBsetscreenbrightness <percentage>\fR
This will set the brightness of all the available 
screens to the given percentage
.Pp
It is also possible to adjust the current value by 
supplying a [+/-] before the number
.Pp
Returns ERROR or SUCCESS based on whether or not it 
was able to make a change.
.E1
.Sh EXAMPLE
pc-sysconfig "setscreenbrightness +5"
.Pp
Will increase screen brightness by five percent for 
you and return SUCCESS if it works or ERROR if it 
can't find a display
