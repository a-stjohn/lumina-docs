" it will be available via the \"Bookmarks\" menu at the top of the window. "
"Removable devices plugged into the sytem will appear in the \"External "
"Devices\" menu, if supported by the operating system. When an item is "
"selected, the icons on the left side of the screen provide the possible "

"include: \"open item\", \"open item\" (will prompt to select the application"
" to use), \"add item to personal favorites\", \"rename item\", \"cut items "
"(add to the clipboard)\", \"copy items to the clipboard\", \"paste items "
"from clipboard\", and \"delete items\". The action buttons are visible by "
"default, but can be made invisible by clicking :menuselection:`View --> Show"
" Action Buttons`. To disable thumbnails, uncheck :menuselection:`View --> "
"Load Thumbnails`. Note that this option does not remove thumbnails that have"
