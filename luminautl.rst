The final element to the upper Insight menus, if configured, is the ZFS
snapshot bar, seen as the long blue line in :ref:`Insight <lumina10>`.
If the system is formatted with ZFS and snapshots of the current
directory are available, this bar allows the user to view the current
directory from previous snapshots. In other words, the user can see past
instances of the directory, as long as ZFS is configured to take
periodic snapshots.

Snapshots are organized with oldest to newest snapshots displayed on the
line from left to right. The text box on the left side of the blue line
shows the active snapshot. Click the text box to view the other
snapshots and choose which snapshots to activate. A slider also exists
which can be used to move the directory back and forward in time,
according to the saved snapshots. The left and right arrows can also be
used for this function.

Underneath the viewing area of Insight are :guilabel:`Magnifying Glass`
icons, used to increase or decrease the size of the objects to display.
Also, the bottom left corner will display tooltips about the highlighted
object or other relevant information.

.. _Lumina Open:

|lumina| Open
=============

To open a file, directory, or URL from the command line, type
:command:`lumina-open` followed by the full path to the file or the URL.
This utility will look for an appropriate application to use to open the
specified file or URL. If there is no default application registered for
the input type, a small dialog will prompt the user to select which
application to use, and optionally set it as the default application for
this file type. As seen in the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina11>`, this dialog organizes the available
applications into three types:

.. _lumina11:

.. figure:: images/lumina11b.png
   :scale: 100%

   : |lumina| Open

* **Preferred:** These applications register their Mime type with the
  system and can open that type of file. Also included are any
  applications used to open this type of file before, as it keeps track
  of the last three applications used for that file type.

* **Available:** Displays all the applications installed on the system,
  organized by category and name.

* **Custom:** The user can manually type in the binary name or path of
  the application to use. A search button is also available for the
  user to graphically search the system for the binary. Whenever text
  is entered, a check is performed to determine if it is a valid
  binary, changing the icon to a :guilabel:`green checkmark` or
  :guilabel:`red X` as appropriate.

.. index:: screenshot
.. _Lumina Screenshot:

|lumina| Screenshot
===================

This utility can be used to take screenshots of the desktop or selected
window and save them as PNG image files. To launch this utility, click
the start menu and select
:menuselection:`Browse Applications --> Utility --> Lumina Screenshot`,
right-click the desktop and select
:menuselection:`Applications --> Utility --> Lumina Screenshot`, type
:command:`lumina-screenshot` from a terminal window, or press
:kbd:`Print Screen`.

On the :guilabel:`New Screenshot` tab, seen here in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina25>`, options are available to fine tune the
screenshot:

   :scale: 100%

   : New Screenshot Tab

* **Entire Session:** Captures the entire screen.

* **Single Screen:** In a multi-monitor setup, the screen number can be
  selected for the screenshot.

* **Single Window:** Captures a selected window. Choose
  :guilabel:`Single Window`, click :guilabel:`Take Screenshot`, and
  click the desired window. The :guilabel:`Include Borders` checkbox
  can be used to determine whether or not the utility will take a
  screenshot of the window with its border frame.
  
* **Delay:** Choose the number of seconds to delay the screenshot. This
  can be used to give more time to prepare the screenshot. For example,
  designating a five second delay on a screenshot will give the user
  time to open a temporary menu or hover over an icon, allowing the
  screenshot to include difficult elements to capture.

There are three options for taking a screenshot: clicking
:guilabel:`Take Screenshot` in the lower-right corner of |lumina|
Screenshot, pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+N`, or selecting
:menuselection:`File --> Take Screenshot`.

After capturing a screenshot, the :guilabel:`View/Edit` tab, seen here
in :numref:`Figure %s <lumina9>`, provides additional options for
manipulating the screenshot:

.. _lumina9:

   :scale: 100%

   : View/Edit Tab

* **Image Preview:** Displays the captured screenshot. Right-click
  the image to view options for zooming in or out. Click and drag across
  the image to highlight an area which can be cropped by pressing
  :guilabel:`Crop` in the lower-right corner. Click again on the image
  to remove a highlighted area.

* **Zoom Slider:** The left side of the :guilabel:`Image Preview` area
  contains the :guilabel:`Zoom Slider`. This tool adjusts the zoom level
  of the captured image as a percentage value. Click the
  :guilabel:`white square` and move the mouse up or down to adjust the
  image scaling. Alternately, mouse over the slider area and use the
  scroll wheel to adjust the scaling.

* **Save As:** Press :guilabel:`Save As` to open a window to specify the
  filename and location for saving the screenshot.

* **Launch Editor:** :guilabel:`Launch Editor` opens a selectable
  image manipulation program.

Additionally, click :menuselection:`File --> Quick Save` to
automatically save the screenshot to the default :file:`/Pictures`
directory and open a window to select an image manipulation program.

   : Search for Files

By default, a :guilabel:`Files or Directories` search is limited to the
user's home directory, as indicated by the :guilabel:`Search: ~` at the
bottom of the screen. :guilabel:`Smart: Off` indicates every
subdirectory is included in the search, with no exlusions. Once
subdirectories have been added to the exclusion list, :guilabel:`Smart:`
switches to :guilabel:`On`, and the excluded subdirectories are shown on
the :guilabel:`Search:` section of the menu. To add more search
directories or to exclude subdirectories, click the :guilabel:`wrench`
to see the screen shown in :numref:`Figure %s <lumina14>`.

   : Search Configuration

Click the :guilabel:`blue folder` icon to change the starting search
directory. For example, select :guilabel:`Computer`, then
:guilabel:`/` from the :guilabel:`Select Search Directory` screen to
search the entire contents of the computer. Click :guilabel:`+` to add
directories to an exclusion list for searching. Delete an exclusion by

brackets are highlighted, lines are numbered, and words wrap dynamically
with the edge of the window. Additionally, selecting

   : Configuring Monitors

In this example, two display inputs are attached to the system and their
current screen resolutions are displayed. If the display input supports
multiple resolutions, these all appear in the :guilabel:`Resolution`
drop-down menu to select a different resolution.

If another display input is attached, the :guilabel:`Add Screen` tab is
activated in order to configure the new input's resolution.
Additionally, the user can choose to make the new input the system
default.
