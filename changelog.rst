.. _Lumina 1.0.0:

Lumina 1.0.0
============

* Files moved/renamed:

    * "Lumina-DE" binary is now "lumina-desktop". Full pathway change: 
      /usr/local/share/Lumina-DE/* -> /usr/local/share/lumina-desktop/*
    * Moved the "runtime" directory in the user's home directory to 
      :file:`XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lumina-desktop` (replaced :file:`~/.lumina`).
    * Changed the install directory where Lumina puts all it's files at 
      install time (:file:`L_SHAREDIR/lumina-desktop/` instead of 
      :file:`L_SHAREDIR/Lumina-DE/`). The required LuminaOS templates 
      have been adjusted to mirror the change.
    * Localization files are now installed via the main source tree, 
      which accounts for the change to :file:`SHARE/lumina-desktop` 
      rather than :file:`SHARE/Lumina-DE`. Also fixed the wallpaper 
      directory detection routine within :command:`lumina-config` (same 
      issue - install dir change broke the path detection).

* Due to the file movement/renaming, all custom settings from previous 
  versions of Lumina will be wiped. All settings will revert to the 
  current 1.0.0 defaults.

* :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` changes:

    * Quicklaunch apps can now be specified within :file:`luminaDesktop.conf`
      in a similar manner to the "favorites" options.
    * Convert the :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` parser to allow relative 
      paths/filenames for favorite or default applications.
    * :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` has been altered to include
      a number of first-install applications.
    * The :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` parser will now properly set 
      mimetypes as needed.
    * Add support for running generic user generated scripts or tools 
      after parsing :file:`luminaDesktop.conf`.
    * Add the ability to specify mimetype defaults within 
      :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` and also allow regex wildcard matching 
      when looking for default applications (ex. :file:`text/*` will 
      grab all text mimetypes).
    * External scripts can be used to set up a new user after Lumina is 
      initialized.
    * Allow relative paths within :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` and updated
      the default apps inside :file:`luminaDesktop.conf`.

* :command:`lumina-config` reworked:

    * Added search capabilities.
    * Rebuilt for faster startup.
    * Added advanced menus to :command:`fluxbox` and :command:`compton` 
      for finer control.
    * General cleanup and fluxbox.
    * Reworked multi-screen selection functionality.
    * Ensure that :command:`lumina-config` defaults to looking in the 
      system installed scripts directory for menu scripts.
    * :command:`lumina-config` can now handle non-integer values for the 
      panel settings as needed.

* The Lumina Desktop binary has been reduced in size.

* New application registrations:
    
    * lumina-fileinfo.desktop
    * lumina-config.desktop
    
* New optional dependencies:
    
    * Compton (recommended compositing manager)
    * xcompmgr (fallback manager)
    
* Compositing can now be disabled entirely by manually editing 
  :file:`/usr/home/tmoore/.config/lumina-desktop/sessionsettings.conf` 
  and adding the line :command:`enableCompositing=false`.
  
* New external script support:

    * Added a new type of menu plugin: "jsonmenu". This is a recursive,
      auto-generating menu which runs an external utility (a script of 
      some kind usually), which generates a JSON document/object which 
      is used to populate the menu.
    * User created scripts.

* Add the new JSON menu generation scripts to the "core" files installed 
  as they are listed as another plugin option.
  
* Add options for grouped windows in the task manager: "Show All", 
  "Minimize All", and "Close All".

* :command:`lumina-fileinfo` can now be used to create new application 
  registrations. By default, applications are registered for the 
  current user on the system, unless otherwise specified. It can 
  also install it's own :file:`.desktop` registrations on the system 
  during installation.
    
* Fixed a bug where panels display with only 5 pixels.

* Fixed a crash with the user button logging out the user.

* Fixed the xterm window title displaying nonsense.

* Fixed :command:`fluxbox` config files.

* Added the "Advanced/Simple" editors to the :command:`fluxbox` keys 
  page.

* The process of finding icons has been reworked for better 
  functionality.

* New wallpaper sizing options: "Fit" and "Full".

* Released a new desktop plugin: "rssreader". This plugin displays an 
  active RSS feed in a configurable window set to the lower right corner
  of the screen by default. This plugin supports the RSS v0.91 and v2.0 
  standards.

* Reset which directories are monitored for apps to be installed into 
  every time the watcher updates (this fixes the detection of KDE apps 
  being installed/removed).
  
* Improved backend search routine for finding .desktop files or binaries.

* The calendar plugin will now move to next day if the system remains on
  over 24 hours.

* :command:`lumina-fm` will remove broken symlinks when deleting 
  directories.
  
* Load previous screen config on Lumina start.

* Fixed the detection and usage of the "mailto:" option in :command:`lumina-open`.
  This also changes the default mimetype used for email applications 
  to "application/email".

* The start menu now hides duplicate "favorite" entries.

* Added a search bar to the start menu to provide users an efficient 
  method to search for apps or utilities directly.
  
* User button - now displays only one entry for applications linked via 
  both the desktop and favorites category.
  
* The nongrouping task manager now uses a uniform size for panel buttons.

* Pressing the :kbd:`Windows button` will open the Start Menu/User 
  Button/ Application Menu, whichever is the default system button.

* Build systems updates:

    * Localizations have been moved from `NO_I18N` to `WITH_I18N`. This 
      will ensure that the source version of the localizations are not
      installed unless explicitly requested (since the "real" 
      localization files are in the lumina-i18n repo - these source 
      files are the autogenerated ones before getting sent up to the 
      pootle localization system).
    * Users can add custom :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` files for a
      particular operating system to simplify builds. Customized 
      :file:`luminaDesktop.conf` files can also pull in default 
      wallpapers for the system.
    * To bypass OS settings check - use "DEFAULT_SETTINGS=<some OS>" in 
      :file:`luminaDesktop.conf`.
  
* A new theme titled "Glass" has been added.

* Added :kbd:`Control+[shift]+Tab` shortcuts for cycling between open 
  windows in grouped order rather than open order (:kbd:`alt+[shift]+tab`
  will do open order).

* Non-applauncher desktop plugins now fill in from the bottom-right of 
  the screen. This provides easily visible separation between the 
  auto-generated launchers and other plugins.

* Have the :command:`lumina-open` dialog show applications on the main 
  list which also have the hidden flag set (since this is for using the 
  app to launch something else - these apps are now valid to show).

* Lumina Text Edit has a new symlink :command:`lte` for quick launching 
  the editor from the command line.

* Fixed the symlink creation routine in :command:`lumina-textedit` to 
  work with package systems.
  
* Setup a recursive :command:`xinit` call within the :command:`start-lumina-desktop`
  binary as needed. This call detects if an "X" session is already 
  active, and will startup "X" if inactive.

* Added the ability for custom, system-wide environment variable 
  settings within :file:`/usr/local/etc/lumina-environment.conf` This 
  allows a system admin the ability to setup customized build 
  environment settings on a global basis. User settings are treated as 
  overrides for the system settings.

* Disabled autoraise in :command:`fluxbox` by default.

* Fixed a crash when right-clicking a non-applauncher desktop plugin and 
  removing it.

* Fixed a crash within the userbutton plugin which would happen after 
  clearing out one of the scroll areas.

* Fixed the resizeMenu's mouse event handling to ensure it keeps 
  control of the mouse during resize events.

* Add a new :file:`LuminaUtils` function for converting a .desktop or 
  binary name into a full path (searching all the various system 
  directories until it finds the file).

* The quick command run routine will now never hang the system for more 
  than 1 second of inactivity from the subprocess.

* Allow the "save file as" option within lumina-textedit to always be 
  available and not dependent on changes to the file.
    
.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.9.0:

Lumina 0.9.0
============

* Created a "Common Applications" tab in the :menuselection:`Lumina Configuration Utility --> "Applications"`
  section and moved common applications settings from the "File Defaults" 
  tab.

* Changed the default wallpapers for Lumina/PC-BSD and added some more 
  4K Lumina wallpapers.

* Updated :command:`lumina-screenshot`: Added a new quicksave option and
  launch editor button for opening a full editor, windows to be snapshot
  may now be clicked on for selection rather than using the list of open
  windows, and screenshots may be cropped as needed within the utility 
  before saving them to a file.
 
* Added new Utility: :command:`lumina-textedit`. This is a simple 
  plaintext editor with syntax highlighting, find/replace support, line 
  numbers, and bracket highlighting.

* Updated the Lumina theme engine to no longer use stylesheets to modify
  non-desktop applications (including the Lumina tools/utilities). This 
  opens the door for a full Qt5 theme plugin to be used for non-desktop 
  utilities instead.

* Updated which XDG mime-types are used for the default web browser and 
  file manager. This should make it align a bit better with what 
  applications expect (if they try to read/use the database directly - 
  such as some popular web browsers do).

* Updated Linux harddrive device detection ("nvme" devices).

* Added Gentoo Linux support and an "ebuild" file.

* Cleanup of some minor source syntax issues with Qt 5.6

* Fixed a number of multi-monitor issues. Screen resizes/changes will 
  now be properly detected on the fly (on any system - including VM's), 
  and panels will be placed properly on monitors not aligned with the 
  y=0 axis.

* Ensured the current system volume gets saved on logout so it can be 
  reloaded on next login (in case the volume was changed by some 
  external tool during the session).

* Added new startup binary: :command:`start-lumina-desktop`. This will 
  be used as the primary "entry point" for launching the desktop as 
  opposed to the "Lumina-DE" binary (please adjust your .xinitrc files 
  and wrapper scripts as needed). The xsession desktop entry that Lumina
  installs was already changed to run this tool, so graphical desktop 
  managers should be unaffected by this change. This tool will 
  eventually be used to perform the X session setup/configuration 
  (so CLI users will not need to run :command:`xinit` or :command:`startx`
  directly anymore), but the X integration has not been implemented yet.

* Updated the FreeBSD appstore shortcut to point to the new 
  appcafe.desktop file from PC-BSD.

* Cleaned many old shell scripts from the source tree (not needed for 
  builds any more).

* Streamlined the build procedures slightly.

* Reorganized the source tree. Now all the Lumina tools/utilities are 
  kept separate from the general build scripts/files within a :file:`src-qt5`
  directory, and additionally organized into categories (core, 
  core-utils, desktop-utils).
  Automated build systems should not be impacted by this change, as the 
  main project file (lumina.pro) has been left in the same place within 
  the repository and just had all the internal paths adjusted 
  accordingly.
 
* Updated all the installed desktop entries to use relative paths for 
  the icons (better cross-OS support).

* Fixed the detection of "sloppy" URL's given to lumina-open.

* Adjusted one of the include files for the Lumina library so external 
  applications can now link against the lib without the availability of 
  the Lumina source tree (although still not recommended).

* Stability fix for the desktop when an invalid desktop plugin is 
  set/registered.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.8:

Lumina 0.8.8
============

* Add 3 different view modes for applications in the start menu: 
  Alphabetical (no categories), Partial Categories, or Categories (need 
  to click the category to go into it and see the applications).
    
* Make the symlink icon overlays a bit smaller at 1/3 icon size instead 
  of 1/2.

* Add a new button for the audio controls to the left side of the 
  :menuselection:`Start --> Preferences` menu for muting and unmuting 
  audio.
    
* The RPM spec for Fedora/CentOS has been refactored.  Within the limits
  of supporting both Fedora and CentOS 7, 32-bit and 64-bit builds can 
  be done from the same spec, so that it complies with Fedora's 
  guidelines on how a package should be structured. 
    
* Improvements to the notepad desktop plugin.
    
* Redo the "App Menu" panel plugin so that it uses a self-contained menu
  and lists the logout options at the bottom.
    
* Fix sorting of "favorites" items in the "Start" menu to be sorted by 
  display name instead of file name.
    
* Add new options for loading new wallpaper files in 
  :command:`lumina-config`: Single Directory (all images within the 
  directory) and Recursive Directory (all images in the selected
  directory and all sub-directories).
    
* Add support for selecting a ZFS snapshot by name, in addition to the 
  current time-slider.

* NetBSD is now a supported build target.
    
* Add the ability to change monitor resolutions in 
  :command:`lumina-xconfig`.
    
* Add support for the Intel backlight, if available, on FreeBSD systems.

* Fixed a translation bug for the Portuguese language.
   
* Fix a crash on FreeBSD 11.x when removing a desktop icon.
    
* Fix a multi-threading issue randomly causing :command:`lumina-fm` to 
  crash when opening a directory.
    
* Fix some resize bugs with the custom resizeMenu class which is used by
  the "Start" menu.
   
* Multiple fixes for resolution detection as well as graphical glitches 
  that were causing menus to behave unpredictably.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.7:

Lumina 0.8.7
============

* Convert everything to XCB and remove XLib dependencies.

* Update DragonFlyBSD support.

* Adjust build procedures to better support multiple concurrent threads 
  using the "-j<#threads>" :command:`make` option.

* Add better relative path support for launching applications in the 
  mimetype database.

* Add support for a new instance of a LuminaSingleInstance application 
  using the "-new-instance" CLI flag.

* Add better fallback methodology for detecting and fixing stale 
  single-instance flags.

* Now uses the Qt5-Concurrent build module for additional 
  multi-threading support in various utilities.

* Add support for selecting a mouse cursor theme (requires session 
  restart).

* Add new color schemes: Grey-Dark, Solarized-Light, Solarized-Dark, and
  Blue-Light.

* Customize the Lumina-default theme.

* Add inheritance to theme files and convert the Lumina-default to 
  inherit the "None" theme.

* Add support to :ref:`Lumina Screenshot` for multi-screen arrangements 
  and for including and excluding window borders for single window 
  snapshots.

* Add support for various background image scaling and placement 
  options.

* Add a number of new desktop shortcuts for the session. This requires 
  existing users to remove their :file:`~/.lumina/fluxbox-keys` before 
  logging in to get the new settings.

* Clean up the panel activation and detection routines to better respond
  to mouse-over events, particularly for auto-hidden panels.

* Completely overhaul the desktop plugin container system. Now it is 
  completely drag and drop based with an intelligent grid of items and 
  locations. Right-click, or click and hold, an item to open a menu of 
  additional plugin configuration options. Note that any previous plugin
  locations will be reset to their defaults during the update to this 
  new system.

* Add support for dropping files and directories from other applications
  onto the desktop, creating a symlink to the desktop folder when 
  appropriate.

* Add font outlining to all desktop items so that the text is visible 
  even if the font color blends into the background image.

* ZFS snapshot browsing is now seemlessly embedded within the directory 
  viewer of :ref:`Insight File Manager`.

* Add support for either tabs or columns when viewing multiple 
  directories at once.

* Replace the "Icon View" mode with the ability to adjust the icon sizes
  as desired.

* Add support for running the slideshow viewer and multimedia player in 
  the background as separate tabs. Add the ability to zoom in/out on a 
  slideshow image as desired.

* Add full drag and drop implementation to Insight File Manager. Can 
  drag files and directories to external applications that support the 
  standard "text/urilist" Mimetype for drag and drop operations.

* Directory and thumbnail loading is now a couple orders of magnitude 
  faster than before. The thumbnail loading routine is now a completely 
  separate background thread, preventing any delays in application 
  functionality while loading.

* Add support for the "back" mouse button when viewing a directory.

* Completely overhaul the :ref:`Lumina File Information` utility. Now it
  is an almost complete front-end for the Qt/Lumina file information and
  XDG entry structures.

* Add support for detecting and allowing user-local Fluxbox themes in 
  addition to system-local themes.

* Decrease initial loading time of :ref:`Lumina Configuration` by making
  it load all the background image thumbnails on demand instead of 
  up-front.

* Update the :ref:`Interface` used for panel configuration so that it is
  much easier to read and use.

* Update the application selection in the fileopen dialog of 
  :ref:`Lumina Open`, making it much easier to find the proper 
  application to open the specified file.

* Overhaul the "Clock" panel plugin. Now it provides a menu with a 
  calendar as well as an option for the user to instantly switch the 
  time zone.

* New "Start Menu" panel plugin is a Windows-esque system menu which 
  incorporates the functionality of both the user button and the system 
  dashboard in one place. This plugin also supports creating and 
  removing desktop links for applications, as well as "quick-launch" 
  buttons for adding applications to the panel.
  
* Update the "Workspace Switcher" panel plugin so it stays in sync with 
  external changes to the current workspace.

* New "Line" panel plugin provides a simple visual line to provide 
  separation between plugins.

* Fix or bypass some Fluxbox window placement bugs.

* Fix some bugs in the user button regarding file and directory 
  removals.

* Clean up a number of built-in text strings for clarity and 
  consistency.

* Ensure that graphical sliders for adjusting screen brightness only go 
  down to 10% to prevent the user from blacking out their screen 
  entirely.

* Update the support for non-xterm terminal emulators to be opened 
  within a particular directory.

* Update URL syntax handling in :ref:`Lumina Open`.

* Update support for sticky windows to appear in the task manager on all
  workspaces.

* Clean up a number of possible bugs with regards to how external 
  application might be launched or used. This fixes the random race 
  condition where a process finished but the thread in Lumina which 
  called it still thinks it is running.

* Ensure that all calendar widgets on the desktop or panel update as 
  necessary to ensure the correct date is shown during multiple-day 
  sessions.

* Add a small CLI flag to :ref:`Lumina Open` for testing the crash 
  handler ("-testcrash").

* Ensure that on FreeBSD, the disk I/O information uses instantaneous 
  values instead of system averages.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.6:

Lumina 0.8.6
============

* Add the ability to set system-locale overrides, used on login. This 
  allows the user to mix locale settings for the various outputs.
        
* Add the ability to switch the locale of the current session on the 
  fly, changing all locale settings for the current session only. These 
  settings will be used when launching any applications within that 
  session.
        
* Fix up the translation mechanisms so that everything is instantly 
  re-translated to the new locale.
        
* More languages are now fully translated. Install the x11/lumina-i18n 
  port or pkg to install the localizations and enable these new 
  localization features.
    
* Add support for the “Actions” extension to the XDG Desktop 
  specifications. This allows applications to set a number of various 
  actions, or alternate startup routines, within their XDG desktop 
  registration file. These actions are shown within Lumina as new 
  sub-menus within the "Applications" menu as well as in the "User" 
  button. Look for the down arrow next to the application's icon.
    
* Change the Lumina On-Screen-Display to a different widget, allowing it
  to be shown much faster.
    
* Add new *_ifexists* functionality to any session options in 
  :file:`luminaDesktop.conf`. This allows the distributor to more easily
  setup default applications, such as the web browser or mail client, 
  through an intelligent tree of options.
        
* Apply a work-around for new users which fixes a bug in Fluxbox where 
  the virtual desktop windows could still be changed or closed by 
  various Fluxbox keyboard shortcuts. If an existing user wants to apply
  this fix, replace their :file:`~/.lumina/fluxbox-keys` with 
  :file:`/usr/local/share/Lumina-DE/fluxbox-keys`. Note that this will 
  overwrite any custom keyboard shortcuts.
        
* Fix some bugs in the new window detection and adjustment routines with
  full-screen apps that modify the X session settings.
        
* Fix a couple bugs with the automatic detection and load routines for 
  the new QtQuick plugins.
        
* Add in the :kbd:`Ctrl-X` keyboard shortcut for cutting items in the 
  :ref:`Insight File Manager`.
        
* Fix up the active reloading of icons when the icon theme changes.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.5:

Lumina 0.8.5
============

* The user button has received a significant speed boost, and can now be
  used for browsing files and directories within the user’s home 
  directory.
   
* Desktop icons have received a large number of changes in styling, 
  amount of visible text, and functionality. There is also a new feature
  to automatically generate plugins for items in the user’s Desktop 
  directory, where each plugin may be individually moved/changed rather 
  than trapped within a container like the “desktopview” plugin.
    
* Added a desktop plugin for monitoring the system hardware status such 
  as memory and CPU usage, CPU temperature, and disk I/O. This 
  functionality requires operating system support and is currently only 
  available for PC-BSD®, FreeBSD, and Debian.
    
* Added a desktop plugin container for running custom QtQuick/QML 
  scripts. While there is only a single sample plugin of this type 
  available at the present time, it is now possible for users to create 
  their own custom interface plugins using the QML scripting language, 
  which is similar to JavaScript or CSS.
  
* Lumina has been fully translated to German, Russian, and Spanish, and 
  almost-completely translated to Catalan (89%), Chinese (61%), Estonian
  (53%), Indonesian (76%), Polish (89%), Portuguese (89%), 
  Portuguese-Brazilian (89%), Swedish (91%), and Turkish (88%).

* The new system for desktop plugin settings requires that any desktop 
  plugins be reset back to defaults when upgrading to this version of 
  Lumina.

* There is a known conflict between Qt 5.4+ and Fluxbox 1.3.7 which 
  prevents the “close” button from working on unlocked desktop plugins. 
  To work around this issue, right-click on the title for the plugin and
  select the “close” option from the menu to remove the desktop plugin. 
  Alternatively, you may also remove desktop plugins using the 
  :ref:`Lumina Configuration` utility.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.4:

Lumina 0.8.4
============

* The panel has been improved to add support for mouse tracking, 
  variable-length panels that use a percentage of the screen edge 
  length, and the ability to pin the panel to a particular location on 
  the screen edge by either corner or centered. 
  
* Rescale the panel size if the monitor used in the previous session was
  a different screen resolution.
  
* For hidden panels, 1% of the panel size is visible on the screen while
  it is hidden, rather than using a hard-coded pixel size. This is 
  better for high-resolution screens.
    
* Remove the restriction that panels be on opposite screen edges.

* :ref:`Lumina Search` now supports the ability to change "Files or 
  Directories" search preferences on a temporary basis. New command-line
  flags can be used to start searches instantly.
    
* Search functionality has been integrated into the 
  :ref:`Insight File Manager`. The :kbd:`Ctrl-F` keyboard shortcut or 
  the “Search” menu option will start a search for a file or directory
  with the current directory as the starting point.
    
* A “Search” button has been added to the  home directory browser in the
  user menu. This allows the user to easily start searching for a file 
  or directory within the selected directory.

* The new “Favorites” system backend is much faster and more reliable 
  than the old system of symbolic links. Existing favorites should be 
  automatically converted to the new format when you log into the new 
  version of Lumina.

* The :command:`lumina-fileinfo` utility can be used to view basic file 
  information, such as timestamps, owner/group information, file size, 
  and read/write permissions. If the file is an XDG
  desktop shortcut that the user has permission to modify, this utility 
  provides the ability to make changes to that shortcut by 
  right-clicking on files in the desktop view plugin or within the 
  :ref:`Insight File Manager` and selecting the “Properties” option.
  
* Better application recommendations for files and URLs, especially for 
  web browsers or email clients.
   
* Major cleanup of XCB library usage.
    
* Hardware-brightness controls now used for PC-BSD® by default, if 
  supported by the system hardware.
    
* Putting the system into the suspend state is now supported for PC-BSD®
  and Debian.
    
* New clock display formats.
    
* A large number of session cleanup and session initialization 
  improvements, including resetting the user’s previous screen 
  brightness and audio volume settings.
   
* New default keyboard shortcuts for tiling the open windows on the 
  screen, on new user configurations only.

* Better support for the URL input format when required by an 
  application.
   
* The user’s “log out” window appears much faster when activated.

* There is a known bug in Lumina 0.8.4 regarding “unlocked” desktop 
  plugins. The close and maximize buttons for the plugin are 
  unresponsive when using Qt 5.4.1, preventing the user from easily 
  removing or maximizing a desktop plugin. As a temporary workaround, 
  right-click the titlebar for the unlocked plugin and select close or 
  maximize from the menu.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.3:

Lumina 0.8.3
============

* Add “Application Launcher” panel plugin which allows the user to pin 
  the shortcut for an application directly to a panel.
   
* Add :ref:`Lumina Xconfig`, a graphical front-end to :command:`xrandr`.
  This utility can be used to easily enable or disable additional 
  monitors and screens within the current desktop session. Shortcuts to 
  this utility are available in the user button plugin and the settings 
  menu plugin.
    
* Fix the issue with transparent system tray icons on FreeBSD 11.
    
* Add support for the XDG autostart specifications.

* Fix a number of bugs related to detecting and using XDG mimetypes.
    
* Add support for the XDG autostart specifications. More work is 
  necessary to convert the current Lumina autostart specification.
     
* Add some additional fallback routines to account for possible errors 
  in :file:`*.desktop` files.

* Add support for creating new (empty) files using 
  :ref:`Insight File Manager`.
     
* Add an option for enabling and disabling the use of image thumbnails.
  This is useful if you have massive image directories, just be sure to 
  disable thumbnails **before** loading the directory.
     
* Add initial drag-and-drop support for moving files and directories 
  within a directory.
     
* Load the specific icon for any application shortcuts.
     
* Add the ability to view file checksums.
     
* Add some additional checks and excludes for copy/move operations in 
  the background to prevent the user from performing illegal operations,
  such as moving a directory into itself.
     
* Add support for listing statistics about the current directory such as
  number of files, total size of files, and percent of the filesystem 
  which is used.
     
* Streamline the frequency of the background directory checker so that 
  it runs much less often.

* Disable the shutdown/restart options on PC-BSD® if the system is in 
  the middle of performing updates in order to add an extra layer of 
  safety.

* Have the shutdown/restart options use the “-o” option on FreeBSD and 
  PC-BSD® so that the system performs the action much faster.
     
* Add support for thumbnails, increasing/decreasing icon sizes, removing
  files, and  cut/copy files to the “desktopview” desktop plugin. This 
  plugin provides traditional desktop icons.
     
* Add support for increasing and decreasing the icon size for the 
  application launcher desktop plugin.
     
* Update the icon used for the “favorites” system in the user button and
  the file manager.
     
* Add the ability to display alternate timezones in the system clock. 
  This does **not** change the system time as it is just a setting for 
  the visual clocks/plugins.
     
* Add a new panel plugin for pinning application shortcuts directly to 
  the panel. This is just like the “applauncher” desktop plugin, but on 
  the panel.
     
* Perform the initial search for applications on the system within the 
  session initialization. This ensure that buttons and plugins are 
  responsive as soon as the desktop becomes visible.
    
* Fix an issue with transparent system tray icons on FreeBSD 11 and 
  convert the system tray embed/unembed routines to use the XCB library 
  instead of XLib.

.. _Lumina 0.8.2:

Lumina 0.8.2
============

* Added :command:`lumina-info` which can be used to display information 
  about the Lumina desktop, such as the version, license, and link to 
  the source repository.

* Large overhaul of the theme templates and color schemes which are 
  available out-of-box.

* The :command:`lumina-config` utility has been rearranged so that its 
  UI is more intuitive and there is a new dialog for selecting plugins. 
  It now has the  ability to set preferred time and date formats and the
  ability to reset default applications back to their default, 
  non-mimetype registrations.
  
* The :ref:`Insight File Manager` has been improved. All file operations
  happen in a separate thread so that the UI does not lag any more and 
  the detection of Qt-editable image files has been fixed.
  
* Added support to update the vertical panel display of the clock 
  plugin. Various desktop plugin stability issues have been fixed and 
  the  session cleanup routine has been streamlined. A second panel is 
  now supported and the number of filesystem watchers has been reduced 
  to one per-session instead of one per-screen.
  
* :ref:`Lumina Search` can now be configured to exclude directories from
  a "Files or Directories" search and to set an alternate start 
  directory.

.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.8.1:

Lumina 0.8.1
============

* New "Audio Player" desktop plugin to play audio files from the 
  desktop.

* New "Home Button" panel plugin to hide all windows and show the 
  desktop and new "Start Menu" panel plugin which provides an 
  alternative to the user button for traditional system management.

* Added the ability to remove or rotate image files while viewing a 
  slideshow with :ref:`Insight File Manager`.

* New backend distribution framework for setting system-wide defaults. 
  This affects new users only as existing settings will not be changed. 
  Also added the ability to reset the desktop back to its defaults using
  the :ref:`Lumina Configuration` utility.

* Allow a customizable user icon which is also used in PCDM 
  (PC-BSD® Display Manager).

* Panels and desktop plugins follow the current theme by default.

* The "Note Pad" desktop plugin has been converted to a file-based 
  utility so that all notes can be found in :file:`~/Notes` for access 
  by other utilities. Plugins are able to load a generic text file to 
  treat like a note for watching or updating.
  
* Auto-hidden panels now stay visible when the mouse moves over the 
  system tray.

* The user button opens faster now as it updates the widget on-demand in
  the background.

* Fixed a bug in :ref:`Lumina Open` for filenames containing multiple 
  "."s not detecting the file extension.

* The log-out window now opens on the current screen and the log-out 
  window is hidden at the start of the log-out procedure.

  multi-monitor systems.

* Special localized characters are now recognized when passed in from 
  the command line.

* Recursive file operations now function properly in 
  :ref:`Insight File Manager`.

* XDG "Exec" field code replacements function better, which fixes KDE 
  application shortcuts like Okular.

* New backend system for registering default applications using 
  mime-types instead of extensions. While all Lumina utilities have been
  updated to work with the new system, previously registered defaults 
  might not be transferred. You may need to reset your default web 
  browser and email client using the :ref:`Lumina Configuration` 
  utility. 
  
.. index:: changelog
.. _Lumina 0.6.2:

Lumina 0.6.2
============

* A desktop plugin system has been implemented with two plugins: a 
  calendar and an application launcher plugin.

* The panel plugin system has been refined with transparency support for
  the panel itself and automatic plugin resizing.

* Added the system dashboard panel plugin which allows control over the 
  audio volume, screen brightness, and current workspace, while also 
  displaying the current battery status, if applicable, and containing a
  button to let the user log out or shutdown/restart the system.
  
* The user button panel plugin has been re-implemented, incorporating 
  the functionality of the desktopbar plugin. Now the user has quick 
  access to files and applications in the :file:`~/Desktop` folder, as 
  well as the ability to add and remove shortcuts to system applications
  in the desktop folder with one click.
  
* New backgrounds wallpapers and a project logo.

* Add the :ref:`Insight File Manager`. Its features include the ability 
  to browse the system and bookmark favorite directories. It includes a 
  simple multimedia player for playing and previewing multimedia files, 
  an image slideshow viewer for previewing image files, full file and 
  directory restore functionality if ZFS snapshots are available, menu 
  shortcuts to quickly browse attached or mounted devices, tabbing 
  support for browsing multiple directories at once, and standard file 
  and directory management such as copy/paste/delete/create. Supported
  multimedia and image formats are auto-detected, so if a particular 
  file is not recognized, install the appropriate library or plugin to 
  provide support.

* Add :ref:`Lumina Screenshot`, a simple utility to create and save 
  screenshots. It can capture the entire system or individual windows. 
  It can delay the image capture for a few seconds as necessary. This 
  utility is automatically assigned to the “Print Screen” keyboard 
  shortcut and is also listed in the application registry under 
  "utilities".

* Add a new implementation of the :ref:`Lumina Configuration` utility. 
  It can now be used to configure desktop appearance such as the 
  background image and to add desktop plugins, configure the location, 
  color, transparency, and size of panels as well as manage their 
  plugins, with up to two panels supported per screen, configure menu 
  plugins, manage global keyboard shortcuts, including shortcuts for 
  adjusting audio volume or screen brightness, manage default 
  applications for the system by categories or individually, manage 
  session options such as enable numlock on log in or to play audio 
  chimes, manage applications and files to be launched on log in, and to
  manage window system options such as appearance, mouse focus policy,
  window placement policy, and the number of workspaces.

* Update the overall appearance of the application selector window in 
  :ref:`Lumina Open`.

* Fully support registered mime-types on the system and recommend those 
  applications as appropriate.
