Contributing to Lumina
**********************

Lumina is an open source project which relies on involvement from its 
users and supporters to assist in development, documentation, and 
localization. This section describes how to best assist the Lumina 
Project.

.. _Report a Bug:

Report a Bug
============
  
One of the most effective ways to assist the Lumina Project is by 
reporting problems or bugs encountered while using Lumina. Subscribing 
to `Lumina News <https://lumina-desktop.org/news/>`_ is a 
good way to keep up-to-date on the availability of new Lumina versions.

Anyone can report a Lumina bug. However, bug reporting should follow a 
few guidelines to ensure a speedy response:

* Lumina is part of the TrueOS® Project, with Lumina bugs reported to 
  the TrueOS® bug tracker. To get begin reporting bugs, navigate to 
  `bugs.pcbsd.org <https://bugs.pcbsd.org>`_, click :guilabel:`Register`,
  fill in the required fields, and reply to the automatic email to 
  confirm creating a new account.
  
.. important:: Use a valid email address when registering, or the new 
			   account will be unable to be confirmed.

* Use the "Search" bar at `bugs.pcbsd.org <https://bugs.pcbsd.org>`_ to 
  see if a similar bug report has already been reported. If a similar 
  report exists, add any additional information to the report via a 
  comment. While it is not required to log in to search existing bugs, 
  adding a comment or creating a new report does require signing into 
  the website.
  
* To create a new bug report, log into the website, then navigate to 
  `<http://bugs.pcbsd.org/projects/pcbsd/issues/new>`_. In the screen 
  shown in :numref:`Figure %s: Creating a Bug Report <bug>`, click the 
  :guilabel:`Category` drop-down menu and select :guilabel:`Lumina Desktop`.

.. _bug:

   :scale: 100%
  
* Write a brief but descriptive "Subject" that includes the error and 
  the version of Lumina. Ideally, the subject is short (8 words or less)
  and contains key words about the error so the bug report is easily 
  found with the search tool.

* In the "Description" field, write about the circumstance of the error,
  including instructions how to recreate it. If an error message is 
  generated, reproduce the error in its entirety. Also, attaching a 
  screenshot to the report can greatly aid the developer in visualizing 
  the problem.
  
* When finished, click :guilabel:`Create` to save the report. The bug 
  tracker will attach a unique number to the report and send update 
  messages to the creator's registered email address whenever activity 
  occurs with the bug report.
  
.. _Become a Translator:

Become a Translator
===================

Translating Lumina into additional languages is extremely helpful to the
developers, and very appreciated! There are two primary elements to 
Lumina which need to be translated: 

1. The graphical elements within Lumina.

2. The Lumina Handbook (this document). 

This section describes each of these elements in more detail and how to 
begin participating in translating Lumina.

An excellent first step is to join the `translations mailing list <http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/translations>`_.
After joining, send an introductory email and indicate which language(s)
and which type(s) of translations you can assist with. Participating in 
the mailing list will keep you up to date with important changes to 
Lumina and help coordinate with the other volunteers.

.. index:: translations
.. _Interface Translation:

Interface Translation
---------------------

Lumina uses `Pootle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pootle>`_ for 
managing the localization of menu screens seen in Lumina. Also, Pootle 
efficiently displays the progress of localization efforts, allowing 
users to quickly find if their language is fully or partially supported 
in Lumina. Further, Pootle simplifies the process to check and submit 
translated text through its integrated web editor and commenting system.
These tools allow translators to spend more of their time making and 
reviewing translations rather than learning how to use a complicated 
tool set.

To see the status of a localization, open the `Lumina translation website <http://translate.pcbsd.org/projects/lumina/>`_
in a web browser, as seen in :numref:`Figure %s: The Lumina Pootle Translation System <translate1>`. 

.. _translate1:

.. figure:: images/translate1.png
   :scale: 100%

Requested localizations are listed alphabetically on the left. If the 
desired language is missing and you would like to help in its 
translation, send an email to the `translations mailing list <http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/translations>`_ 
so it can be added.

The green bar in the "Progress" column indicates the percentage of 
Lumina menus that have been localized. Any language not at 100% 
translation will display the incomplete menus in English.

Click on a language name to see each available menu item for translation
. :numref:`Figure %s: Viewing a Language's Available Menus <translate2>`
shows the Greek localization. In this example, the menu for 
"lumina-search" is almost complete, but the translation for 
"lumina-config" has not been started yet.

.. _translate2: 

.. figure:: images/translate2.png
   :scale: 100%

A Pootle login account is necessary to edit a translation. Log in to 
Pootle and navigate to the desired menu item in need of translation. In 
:numref:`Figure %s: Using the Pootle Interface to Edit a Translation String <translate3>`,
the translator has clicked on "lumina-config.ts" then clicked the 
"Continue translation" link.

.. _translate3:

.. figure:: images/translate3.png
   :scale: 100%

In this example, the phrase "Select Application" needs to be translated. 
To add the translation, type the translated text into the white text 
field and click the "Submit" button. To translate another text field, 
click the hyperlink associated with its name or use the "Next" and 
"Previous" links to navigate between text fields. Sometimes, as seen in 
this example, a text field exists in another screen and already has a 
translation. In this case, you can click the link for a "Similar 
translations" and it will be added to the field for you so that you can 
"Submit" it.

If help is needed with a translation or general use of the Pootle 
system, please ask for help on the translations mailing list or in the
`translations forum <https://forums.pcbsd.org/forum-40.html>`_.

.. _Documentation Translation:

Documentation Translation
-------------------------

At this time, the Lumina Handbook has not yet been added to the 
translation system. Once it has, instructions for translating the 
Handbook will be added here.

.. _Become a Developer:

Become a Developer
==================

Developers who want to help improve the Lumina codebase are always 
welcome! To participate in core development, please subscribe to the 
`developers mailing list <http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/dev>`_. 

All Lumina utilities are developed with C++ using Qt Libraries, but 
other Qt-based languages are used in the project too. For example, the 
CSS-like `Qt Stylesheet language <http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/stylesheet.html>`_ 
is used for theme templates.

.. index:: development
.. _Getting the Source Code:

Getting the Source Code
-----------------------

Lumina uses `github <https://github.com/trueos/lumina>`_ to store its 
source code. 

.. note:: Be sure :command:`git` in installed on your system prior to 
	      downloading the source code. TrueOS® includes :command:`git` 
	      as part of the base install.

To download the source code, use the command line to navigate to (or 
create) the desired storage directory and from within the directory, 
type::

    git clone git://github.com/trueos/lumina.git
    git pull

These commands will create a directory named :file:`lumina/`, which 
contains the local copy of the repository. Keep the local copy 
synchronized with the official repository by typing :command:`git pull` 
within the :file:`lumina/` directory.

To compile the source code, start by checking the `list of required software <https://github.com/trueos/lumina/blob/master/DEPENDENCIES>`_ 
to install any needed Qt5 modules. Alternately, :command:`pkg install qt5` 
will install all available Qt5 modules, which ensures the system can 
compile the source code.

.. note:: The :command:`pkg` system is used by FreeBSD based operating 
	      systems; other OS's will use different packaging systems and 
	      command syntax.

Once the necessary Qt elements are installed, compile the source by 
typing :command:`qmake` to generate a :file:`Makefile`, then run 
:command:`make`. This example is using a TrueOS® system; the binary 
paths may differ on other operating systems: ::

    cd lumina

    /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake

    make


.. note:: If you encounter an issue trying to compile the source on a 
	      system other than TrueOS®, refer to the "How to build from 
	      source" section of the `README <https://github.com/trueos/lumina/blob/master/README.md>`_ 
	      for additional instructions.
 
To also install the compiled applications, type :command:`sudo make install`. 
Note this command requires superuser privileges.
 
Several Qt integrated development environments (IDE) are available for 
development. These IDEs can be installed using AppCafe® on TrueOS® or 
other operating systems' software management utilities. 
`QtCreator <http://wiki.qt.io/Category:Tools::QtCreator>`_ is a fully 
featured IDE designed to help new Qt developers acclimate quickly, as 
well as boost the productivity of experienced developers. 
`Qt Designer <http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/designer-manual.html>`_ is a 
lighter weight option as it includes only a :file:`.ui` file editor with
no other IDE functionality.

To submit changes for inclusion in Lumina, fork the 
`repository <https://github.com/trueos/lumina>`_ using the instructions 
in `fork a repo <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_. Make 
any changes to the forked repository, them submit them for inclusion in 
the primary Lumina repository via a 
`git pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_. 
Once the submitted changes have been reviewed, they can either be 
committed to the repository or returned to the creator with additional 
suggestions for improvement.

.. _Design Guidelines:

Design Guidelines
-----------------

Lumina is a project driven by the support of developers within the 
community. Developers have designed and implemented a number of new 
utilities and tools into Lumina since its inception. The Project aims to
present a unified design in order to retain the familiarity of most 
programs. For example, while programs have had the titles of "File", 
"Main", or "System" as the first entry in a menu bar, Lumina opts to use 
"File", as it is the most common option for the first category on a menu 
bar.

The `Developer Guidelines <https://github.com/trueos/lumina/blob/5beb2730a9e8230d2377ea89e9728504ea88de9c/DeveloperGuidelines.txt>`_ 
contain some coding practices for creating effective updates or 
utilities. For menu and program design in Lumina, there is a small list 
guidelines that volunteer developers are encouraged to follow.

Any graphical program which is a fully featured utility, such as 
:ref:`Insight File Manager`,  needs a "File" menu. However, a "File" 
menu is not necessary for a small widget or dialogue box. When making a 
file menu, try to keep it very simple. Most Lumina utilities include 
only two or three items in the "File" menu.

"Configure" is the Lumina standard for the category of settings or 
configuration related settings. If additional categories are needed, it 
is recommended to look through other Lumina utilities for common naming 
conventions.

File menu icons are taken from the installed icon theme. Table 5.3a 
lists some commonly used icons and their default file names.


**Table 5.3a: Commonly Used File Menu Icons** 

+-----------+-----------------+--------------------+
| Function  | File Menu Icon  | File Name          |
+===========+=================+====================+
| Quit      | row 1, cell 2   | window-close.png   |
+-----------+-----------------+--------------------+
| Settings  | row 2, cell 2   | configure.png      |
+-----------+-----------------+--------------------+


Lumina utilities use these buttons: 

* **Apply:** Applies settings and leaves the window open.

* **Close:** Closes a program without applying settings.

* **OK:** Closes the dialogue window and saves settings.

* **Cancel:** Closes the dialog window without applying settings.

* **Save:** Saves settings and can also close the window. 

Keyboard shortcuts are extremely useful to many users, and Lumina 
attempts to include shortcuts in every utility. Qt simplifies assigning 
keyboard shortcuts. For example, configuring keyboard shortcuts to 
browse the "File" menu is as simple as adding :command:`&File` to the 
menu entry's text field during application creation. Whichever letter 
has the *&* symbol in front will become the new hotkey. A shortcut key 
can also be made by clicking the menu or submenu entry and assigning a 
shortcut key. Avoid creating duplicate hotkeys or shortcuts. Every entry in a menu or submenu should have a key assigned for accessibility. Tables 5.3b and 5.3c summarize the commonly used shortcut and hotkeys.

**Table 5.3b: Shortcut Keys** 

+---------------+---------+
| Shortcut Key  | Action  |
+===============+=========+
| CTRL + Q      | Quit    |
+---------------+---------+
| F1            | Help    |
+---------------+---------+

**Table 5.3c: Hot Keys** 

+-----------+-----------------+
| Hot Key   | Action          |
+===========+=================+
| Alt + Q   | Quit            |
+-----------+-----------------+
| Alt + S   | Settings        |
+-----------+-----------------+
| Alt + I   | Import          |
+-----------+-----------------+
| Alt + E   | Export          |
+-----------+-----------------+
| ALT + F   | File Menu       |
+-----------+-----------------+
| ALT + C   | Configure Menu  |
+-----------+-----------------+
| ALT + H   | Help Menu       |
+-----------+-----------------+
