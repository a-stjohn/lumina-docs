Appearance
==========

This category is used to change the visual appearance and functionality
of the desktop on a per-screen basis. The
:guilabel:`Change Desktop Theme` option, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina17d>`, can be used to change the default
font, font size, theme template, color scheme, icon pack, and mouse
cursors.

   Modifying the Theme

It is possible to create your own **theme template** or **color scheme**
by clicking :guilabel:`Edit` next to those options and changing the
settings as necessary. :numref:`Figure %s <lumina18c>`
shows an example of clicking :guilabel:`Edit` with the
:guilabel:`Glass (System)` theme template selected. This action opened
the :guilabel:`Theme Editor` and the user has clicked the color selector
(dropper icon) in the upper right corner. Select an item in this menu to
edit the template controlling the selection by changing the values in
the theme editor box. Note the theme templates are written as
`Qt stylesheets <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html>`_, so some
scripting experience will be helpful when configuring a theme. After
making your changes, click :guilabel:`Save` to save the theme without
closing the editor, or click :guilabel:`Apply`, which saves the theme
and closes the editor.

   of files. These applications, when configured to use the
   :command:`lumina-open` or :command:`xdg-open` utilities, will refer
   back to the default applications set in
   :guilabel:`Default Applications for File Type`.

The :guilabel:`Advanced` tab allows for configuring the default
application used for particular file types, as seen in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina7e>`.

.. figure:: images/lumina5f.png
   :scale: 100%

   Lumina Panel Configuration

This screen can be used to customize the location, alignment, size,
theme, and plugins for an existing panel. The :guilabel:`+` and
:guilabel:`-` icons towards the top, next to :guilabel:`Panel 1` can be
used to add or remove additional panels. Panels must be aligned along a
screen edge, opposite screen edges in the case of two panels, and may
have any width, color, or transparency.

.. note:: When adding panels, a frame similar to :guilabel:`Panel 1`
   will be created for each panel, labeled :guilabel:`Panel 2`,
   :guilabel:`Panel 3`, and so on. This allows each panel to be
   configured separately. The configuration tabs available for a panel
   are described below. Be sure to select the tab in the desired panel.

The :guilabel:`Location` tab (4 arrow icon) contains a number of items:

* **Edge:** This drop-down menu can be used to set the location of the
  panel which can be *Top*, *Bottom*, *Left*, or *Right*.

* **Alignment:** This drop-down menu can be used to center the panel on
  the edge or pin it to one of the corners.

* **Size:** Can be used to specify the panel width in pixels and the
  panel length.

The :guilabel:`Appearance` tab (monitor icon) is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina19d>`.

.. _lumina19d:

   Panels Plugins Tab

To add a plugin as an icon to the panel, click :guilabel:`+` below the
listed plugins and select a plugin from the list that appears. To remove
a plugin, highlight it and click :guilabel:`-`, which is below the
listed plugins. The arrow buttons can be used to move the location of
the plugin on the panel. The top of an ordered list corresponds to
either the top of a vertical panel or the left side of a horizontal
panel.

By default, |lumina| will have one panel which stretches across the
bottom of the primary screen and another auto-hiding panel centered at
the top of the screen. The bottom panel incorporates the
:ref:`Panel Start Menu`, :ref:`Task Manager Plugin (No Groups)`, a
:ref:`Spacer`, :ref:`System Tray`, :ref:`Time Date`, and
:ref:`Battery Monitor` plugins. The top panel includes the
:ref:`Desktop Bar` between two :ref:`Spacer` plugins.

.. _User Settings:

User Settings
=============

The :guilabel:`User Settings` option governs the general settings for
the desktop session. Typically, these settings are infrequently changed.

:guilabel:`General Options`, seen in :numref:`Figure %s <lumina12f>`,
is used to govern numerous settings for the desktop experience.

.. _lumina12f:

.. figure:: images/lumina12f.png
   :scale: 100%

   |lumina| General Options

The user can choose to automatically enable numlock, play chimes when
|lumina| starts or exits, and change the icon that appears in the login
menu and the start menu button. There are also options to set the time
and date format, as well as the time display format (using a drop menu).
Additionally, a user can reset **all** their desktop settings via
:guilabel:`Return to system defaults`, which returns |lumina| to the
defaults created by the OS, while :guilabel:`Return to LuminaÂ® defaults`
returns to the |lumina| created settings.

The :guilabel:`Localization Settings` is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina21c>`.

.. _lumina21c:

.. figure:: images/lumina21c.png
   :scale: 100%

   Session Locale Tab

The **lumina-i18n** package provides localization files. Once installed,
this allows customization of the locale used for the various items
listed in :numref:`Figure %s <lumina21c>`. To install this package on a
|trueos| or FreeBSD system, type :command:`sudo pkg install lumina-i18n`.
On other operating systems, use the default software management tool.
Since each setting has its own drop-down menu, there is flexibility to
select different locales for each item shown in this screen. If any
changes are made in the :guilabel:`Locale` tab, click
:guilabel:`Save Changes` and restart |lumina| to load the configured
locales.

Installing the **lumina-i18n** package will also add a drop-down menu to
the :guilabel:`Preferences` area of the start menu, though |lumina| will
need to be restarted after the package installation to add the locale
menu to :guilabel:`Preferences`. This drop-down menu is used to
change the locale for the current session only. This will immediately
change the localization of any translated menu items without requiring
a restart of |lumina|.

.. note:: If using |lumina| with a language other than English, any menu
          items that continue to be displayed in English have not yet
          been translated to the selected language. To assist the
          |lumina| Project in translating menu items, see
          :ref:`Interface Translation`.
